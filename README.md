## 📜 About Project

> 42 School So Long project is a small 2D game where the player has to collect items and reach the exit. \
> The project is designed to introduce the basics of game development and graphical programming, but I almost rewrote the complete original pacman.

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](en.subject.pdf).

	🚀 TLDR: This project is an introduction to the basics of game development using the MiniLibX library.
    Learn about handling events, rendering graphics, and managing game states.

> [!NOTE]  
> Because of 42 School norm requirements:
> * Each function can't have more than 25 lines of code.
> * All variables are declared and aligned at the top of each function.
> * Project should be created just with allowed functions otherwise it's cheating.
